"""
This module provides functions to upsert and delete documents in a Couchbase database.

The `upsert_document` function takes a key and a document dictionary, and upserts
the document to the specified Couchbase collection. It prints the CAS
(compare-and-swap) value of the upserted document and the execution time of the
operation.

The `delete_airline_by_key` function takes a key and deletes the corresponding
document from the specified Couchbase collection. It prints the CAS value of the
deleted document and the execution time of the operation.

The module also includes the necessary setup code to connect to a Couchbase
cluster and obtain references to the bucket and collection.
