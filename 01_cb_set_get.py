"""
Upserts a document to the specified Couchbase collection and retrieves the document by its key.

The `upsert_document` function takes a key and a document dictionary as input, and upserts 
the document to the specified Couchbase collection. It prints the CAS (Compare-And-Swap) 
value of the upserted document and the time taken to perform the operation.

The `get_airline_by_key` function takes a key as input, and retrieves the document 
from the specified Couchbase collection by its key. It prints the content of the 
retrieved document and its CAS value, as well as the time taken to perform the operation.

The code also demonstrates how to connect to a Couchbase cluster, get a reference to a 
bucket and collection, and how to cleanly close the connection to the cluster.
