"""
This module provides functions for interacting with a Couchbase cluster and 
performing subdocument operations on a specific collection.

The `upsert_document` function inserts or updates a document in the specified collection.

The `sub_get_airline` function retrieves the `name` and `timestamp` fields from a 
document in the specified collection.

The `sub_update_airline` function updates the `name` and `timestamp` fields of a document 
in the specified collection, using the provided CAS value to ensure the update is atomic.

The module also includes the necessary setup code to connect to the Couchbase cluster and 
obtain references to the bucket and collection.

###############
#####LIMIT#####
###############
The maximum number of subdocument operations that can be executed in a single MutateIn or 
LookupIn request is 16. This means you can combine up to 16 individual subdocument operations 
(like upsert, insert, remove, get, etc.) within one MutateIn or LookupIn call. If you try 
to perform more than 16 operations in a single request, it will fail.
